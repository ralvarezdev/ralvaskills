# Repo Tooling Architecture

Productivity files that live at the repo root, are language-agnostic, and shape how every contributor and CI step interacts with the code. Pairs with every language and framework architect skill. See [STACK.md](STACK.md) for pinned tool versions.

## Decision model

Add a tool when **all three** are true:

1. **It pays back on day one.** Not "useful eventually" — useful from the first PR.
2. **The cost of installing it is smaller than the cost of going without it.** A 30-second install is fine; a 30-minute setup that breaks once per OS is not.
3. **There's no language-native option that already covers it.** `go test` doesn't need a Makefile wrapper. `uv run` doesn't need `task` for one-language projects.

When in doubt, skip. Tools you add later are easy; tools you remove are political.

## 1. `.editorconfig`

Always include. Universal editor support, zero ceremony, ends the indent-style wars before they start.

```ini
# .editorconfig
root = true

[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true

[*.{go,Makefile}]
indent_style = tab

[*.{yml,yaml,json}]
indent_size = 2

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false  # Markdown uses trailing spaces for hard breaks
```

## 2. `.gitignore`

Always include. Curate per language; never copy a 500-line GitHub default that contains entries for languages you don't use.

- **Use [github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)** as the source for the base section per language.
- **Trim aggressively.** A clean `.gitignore` is documentation; a noisy one is noise.
- **Local-only exclusions** (`.idea/`, `.vscode/settings.json`) go in `.git/info/exclude` per-developer or `~/.gitignore_global`, not the repo's `.gitignore`.

## 3. Tool version pinning — mise (default), proto (alternative)

The problem: "works on my machine" because each dev has different Go / Python / Node versions. CI uses yet another version. Fix: pin every tool the repo needs in a file, install with one command.

### Default: `mise` with `mise.toml`

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
go = "1.26"
python = "3.14"
node = "22"
task = "3.51"
golangci-lint = "2.12"
buf = "1.69"
trivy = "0.70"
```

```bash
mise install                     # installs everything pinned
```

- **Why mise as default:** broadest tool coverage via asdf-legacy plugins, available through `winget`/`brew`/`scoop`.
- **Shell activation required:** `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` (or zsh/fish/pwsh equivalent).

### Alternative: `proto` with `.prototools`

Same key-value shape, file named `.prototools`, install with `proto install`. Pick proto when you want strict separation (proto manages only binary versions; `task` handles env + tasks) and no shell-activation step (PATH-shim based). Trade-off: smaller plugin ecosystem; obscure tools may need a custom WASM plugin.

**Either way:** the pinned-versions file is committed; CI installs the same versions; nobody runs "whatever's on their machine."

## 4. Task runner — Task (default) or just (alternative)

The problem: every project has 5–15 commands a contributor needs to know (`go build`, `go test --race`, `docker compose up -d db`, `task generate-protos`, etc.). Without a runner, they live in stale README sections.

**Default: skip a task runner for single-language projects.** `go build`, `uv run`, `npm` are enough. Don't wrap them in `task build:` aliases — that's ceremony.

**Add a task runner when:** multi-language repo, multi-service compose stack, or a meaningful number of multi-step commands.

### Default: Task with `Taskfile.yml`

```yaml
# Taskfile.yml
version: '3'

dotenv: ['.env', '.env.local']

tasks:
  default:
    desc: List all tasks
    cmds:
      - task --list

  proto:
    desc: Regenerate Go code from .proto files
    sources:
      - 'proto/**/*.proto'
    generates:
      - 'internal/**/*.pb.go'
    cmds:
      - buf generate

  test:
    desc: Run all tests with race detector
    cmds:
      - go test -race ./...

  up:
    desc: Start dev stack (DB + app)
    cmds:
      - docker compose up -d
```

- **Why Task as default:** built-in `sources:` / `generates:` for incremental builds, `--watch` mode, first-class Windows support (ships its own POSIX-sh interpreter), built-in `dotenv:` loading.
- **Discoverability:** `task --list` shows every task with its `desc`.

### Alternative: just with `justfile`

Makefile-style brevity over YAML; recipes look like shell. Add `set windows-shell := [...]` and `set dotenv-load` at the top. Pick `just` when you prefer terseness, don't need incremental builds, and all collaborators are on macOS/Linux. Trade-off: no native incremental builds, no `--watch` mode.

**Settle on one per repo.** Don't mix `Taskfile.yml` and `justfile`.

## 5. Pre-commit hooks — minimal, opt-in

The problem: minor issues (trailing whitespace, committed secrets, large files) reach CI when they could have been blocked locally. Fix: a tiny pre-commit hook set that catches *only* what can't be caught later or that's genuinely fast.

**Strong opinions exist.** Some teams love pre-commit; some find it slows commits / blocks WIP commits. The minimal-hook stance is the compromise: catch real risks, never run language-specific linters or formatters in commit hooks (those run in editor-on-save and again in CI).

### `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — minimal set

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.6.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
        exclude: '\.md$'             # markdown uses trailing space for hard breaks
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-added-large-files
        args: ['--maxkb=500']
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-json

  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    rev: v8.21.0
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks                 # secret detection
```

- **Install:** `pre-commit install` once per clone.
- **Run on demand:** `pre-commit run --all-files` (or wire into a Task: `task lint:precommit`).
- **No language-specific linters.** `ruff`, `golangci-lint`, etc. run in editor (on save) and again in CI. Running them in a pre-commit hook duplicates work and slows commits.
- **Skip on a single commit:** `git commit --no-verify` is fine; over-policing pre-commit erodes trust.

## 6. Environment variables

The problem: secrets and config diverge across machines, leak into git, or get exported globally and bleed across projects.

### Pattern

- **Non-secret config: `.env` + `.env.local`**, loaded by Task's `dotenv:` directive.
  - `.env` is committed (defaults safe for any contributor — `LOG_LEVEL=info`, `DB_HOST=localhost`).
  - `.env.local` is git-ignored (per-developer overrides — `LOG_LEVEL=debug`).
- **Real secrets: external secret manager.** Never in `.env`, never committed:
  - **1Password CLI** (`op run --env-file=.env.template -- task up`) — solo / small team
  - **doppler** (`doppler run -- task up`) — team
  - **Cloud secret manager** (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager) — production injection at runtime
- **No `direnv`** unless you need automatic activation when you `cd` into a directory. Task's `dotenv:` covers the common case without a second tool.

### `.env` shape

```
# .env — committed, safe defaults
LOG_LEVEL=info
APP_PORT=8080
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=myapp_dev
```

```
# .env.local — git-ignored, per-developer overrides + dev secrets
LOG_LEVEL=debug
DB_PASSWORD=dev-only-not-a-real-secret
```

**`.gitignore` must include `.env.local`.** Audit any `.env*` pattern: only ignore variants that hold secrets; commit the safe ones.

## 7. Dependency updates — Renovate (default), Dependabot (acceptable)

The problem: dependency updates accumulate until they hit a security advisory or a breaking version, then a week of catch-up is needed. Automate it.

### Default: Renovate

`renovate.json` at the repo root:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": ["config:recommended"],
  "schedule": ["before 6am on Monday"],
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["minor", "patch"],
      "groupName": "minor + patch updates"
    },
    {
      "matchPackageNames": ["go", "python", "node"],
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["major"],
      "automerge": false,
      "labels": ["language-bump"]
    }
  ],
  "vulnerabilityAlerts": {
    "enabled": true,
    "labels": ["security"]
  }
}
```

- **Why Renovate:** grouping rules, scheduled batches, broader ecosystem coverage (Go modules, Python, npm, Docker tags, GitHub Actions, Terraform).
- **Group minor + patch updates** into one weekly PR — review-bandwidth-friendly.
- **Security updates land immediately** — never queued.
- **Major bumps stay separate, labeled, never auto-merged** — they deserve a human read.

### Acceptable: Dependabot

For tiny single-language repos where Renovate's flexibility is overkill, GitHub's built-in Dependabot is fine. Same pattern (security immediate, minor grouped, major labeled).

## 8. When to skip the whole thing

This skill is opinionated about *adding* tools, but the strongest opinion is **don't add what you don't need.**

- **Single-language single-service project:** skip the task runner (use native tooling), keep `mise`/`proto` for version pinning if more than one dev exists.
- **Solo throwaway project:** `.editorconfig` and `.gitignore`. That's it.
- **Documentation-only repo:** `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, optional pre-commit for trailing whitespace.
- **Library / SDK with one entry point:** language-native tooling + Renovate. No Task, no mise needed.
- **Multi-language monorepo / multi-service compose stack:** the full stack — `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `mise.toml` (or `.prototools`), `Taskfile.yml`, `pre-commit-config.yaml`, `renovate.json`, `docker-compose.yaml`.

Default to less. Add when the friction is real.
